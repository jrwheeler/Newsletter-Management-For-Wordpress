### Newsletter Manager For Wordpress

This newsletter manager, uses mail chimp as the primary mail service. Users who sign up are enrolled to the appropriate mailing lists in mailchimp. When a user unsubscribes from a list it records the changes in the database through a mailchimp callback. This plugin requires the mailchimp api PHP wrapper and is stored in assets/vendors/.

Through the Wordpress admin users will be able to update subscriber information and that is pushed directly to mailchimp. Filtering the subscribers by current and past subscribers provides a quick way to get an overall understanding of the current number of subscribers.
